Explanation:
1.	Input Argument: The function expects an action key in the event payload with a value of either terminate or stop.
2.	Describe Instances: Filters for instances in the running state.
3.	Action Handling:    
    a - If terminate is passed, the function calls terminate_instances.
    b - If stop is passed, the function calls stop_instances.
4.	Validation: If no valid action is provided, the function returns a 400 error.

Example Event Payload:
To terminate instances:
    {
    "action": "terminate"
    }

To stop instances:
    {
    "action": "stop"
    }
Deployment:
1.	Save the code in a file (e.g., terminate_or_stop_instances_lambda.py).
2.	Create an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
3.	Attach the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy to the Lambda execution role.
4.	Deploy the function and test it with the appropriate event payload.
